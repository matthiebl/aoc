# Advent of Code

A collection of my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Coding in `python3`. May explore `TypeScript` and/or `Haskell` later for some type fun!

I use my own general utility functions that I have collected
from doing previous AoC's to speed up the boring stuff.

## Using

Since python is so fun, the easiest way to use any of my
code would be to copy the `utils.py` file into the year you
want. Rename it to `aocutils.py` and run
`python3 <day>.py <path/to/input>`. You need to ensure that
the [`aocd` package](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/)
is also installed for your version of python.

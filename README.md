# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

Coding in `python3` as usual. May explore `TypeScript` and/or `Haskell` later for some type fun!

I use my own general helper functions that I have collected from doing previous AoC's to speed up the boring stuff.

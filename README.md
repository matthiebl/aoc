# Advent of Code

A collection of my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Coding in `python3`. May explore `TypeScript` and/or `Haskell` later for some type fun!

I use my own general utility functions that I have collected
from doing previous AoC's to speed up the boring stuff.

## Using

In order to use any of my code, you will need my `/utils.py` file.
This contains a few useful functions I have kept handy to speed up
my solves.

Since python is so fun, importing the file in the current structure
is unlikely to work for you. I recommend moving the `utils.py` file
into the same directory as the file you are trying to execute.

By default, running `python3 X.py` will look for the file `X.in` as
the input file to use. So put your input in that file, or you can
specify a file with `python3 X.py your-input-file`.
